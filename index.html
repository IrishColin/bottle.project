<h1><center>bottle project</center></h1>
<h2><center>A project created by Colin and Fionn.</center></h2>

  
  <h2><center>Idea/<center>
  </h2>
  <p><center>The original group consisted of two members, Colin and Josh Birney. Unfortunately due tp circumstances Josh was lost to a tragic aciddent.
    Josh was thirsty at the time and the idea came from his once great mind. Once Josh was gone :( Fionn was drafted onto the team.</center></p>
    
  
  <h2><center>Development</center></h2>
  <p><center>Fionn started the poject off by building a timer that would count upwards. Colin then deveoped a code for a micro bit for when it is tilted.
    we added these two codes together which was harder then we first expected. After a few classes working on it Fionn made a breakthrough.
    This meant that we could contiue with our project and the boys were no longer stuck.</center></p>
